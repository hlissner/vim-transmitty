INTRODUCTION                                    *transmitty*

A simple vim plugin that lets you send the current file to Transmit,
leveraging its "dropsend" feature. The plugin also does a shallow search for
for filetypes that are compiled. For example, CSS stylesheet compiled from
SCSS, LESS or Stylus.

REQUIREMENTS                                    *transmitty-requirements*

This should go without saying: this is MAC ONLY. You also need Transmit in
your /Applications folder.

USAGE                                           *transmitty-usage*

The plugin provides two simple shortcuts:

    " Send this file to Transmit"
    <leader>u       

    " Send this file to Transmit (but don't look for compiled files)
    <leader>U       

It will search for compiled files for any filetype that's been registered in the
g:transmittyLookupExts dictionary. These are the provided defaults:

    let g:transmittyLookupExts = {
        'sass':     ['../css', 'css'],
        'scss':     ['../css', 'css'],
        'less':     ['../css', 'css'],
        'stylus':   ['../css', 'css'],
        'haml':     ['../', 'html'],
        'jade':     ['../', 'html'],
        'slim':     ['../', 'html'],
        'coffee':   ['../js', 'min.js'],
    }

SETTINGS                                        *transmitty-settings*

If you'd like to make your own maps, you may disable the automatically mapped
shortcuts like so:
>
    let g:transmittyNoMappings = 1
<
And then bind keys to these two Plugs:
>
    " Uploads current file (but checks for compiled files, if applicable)
    <Plug>(transmitty-upload)

    " Uploads current file (does no checking)
    <Plug>(transmitty-upload-this)
<
If you'd like to add/set your own filetypes for compiled file checking:
>
    " folder_to_search is relative to the open file. It can be an absolute
    " path if you want (though not recommended).
    let g:transmittyLookupExts["filetype"] = ["folder_to_search", "extension"]
