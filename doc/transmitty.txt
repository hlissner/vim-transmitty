INTRODUCTION                                    *transmitty*

A simple vim plugin that sends the current file to Transmit to be uploaded,
using its "dropsend" feature. The plugin also does a shallow search for
compiled files. For example, if you're working on a SCSS, LESS or Stylus
stylesheet, it will try to look for the compiled CSS stylesheet and upload
that instead.

REQUIREMENTS                                    *transmitty-requirements*

This should go without saying: this is MAC ONLY and you need Transmit.

USAGE                                           *transmitty-usage*

The plugin provides two simple shortcuts:

    " Send this file to Transmit"
    <leader>ou       

    " Send this file to Transmit (but don't look for compiled files)
    <leader>oU       

It will search for compiled files for any filetype that's been registered in the
g:transmittyLookupExts dictionary. These are the provided defaults:

    let g:transmittyLookupExts = {
        'sass':     ['../css', 'css'],
        'scss':     ['../css', 'css'],
        'less':     ['../css', 'css'],
        'stylus':   ['../css', 'css'],
        'haml':     ['../', 'html'],
        'jade':     ['../', 'html'],
        'slim':     ['../', 'html'],
        'coffee':   ['../js', 'min.js'],
    }

SETTINGS                                        *transmitty-settings*

If you'd like to make your own maps, you may disable the automatically mapped
shortcuts like so:
>
    let g:transmitty_no_mappings = 1
<
And then bind keys to these two Plugs:
>
    " Uploads current file (but checks for compiled files, if applicable)
    <Plug>TransmittyUploadLook

    " Uploads current file (does no checking)
    <Plug>TransmittyUploadNoLook
<
If you'd like to add/set your own filetypes for compiled file checking:
>
    " folder_to_search is relative to the open file. It can be an absolute
    " path if you want (though not recommended).
    let g:transmitty_lookup_exts["filetype"] = ["folder_to_search", "extension"]
<
